Classify the Bee's 
identify Honey Bees and Bumble Bees given an image of these insects! 

For this project, the documentation for scikit-learn, scikit-image, and numpy will be helpful resources! For more information about bees, see the BeeSpotter project or the DrivenData competition.

The recommended prerequisites for this Project are Intermediate Python, Introduction to Data Visualization with Matplotlib, Supervised Learning with scikit-learn, and Na√Øve Bees: Image Loading and Processing.

You will learn how to use HOG, PCA dimensionality reduction, using SVC model from SVM, checking AUC/ROC curve
